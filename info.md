👟 This app explores my running data via the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com). The charts below compare the latest 3 runs based on 5 performance metrics and a time trend of how pace varies with heart rate.

Use the sidebar to tweak the parameters and perform clustering on the data which will return a preview below and an option to download the full output as a CSV file for further analysis. 

💡 Credits: the fantastic [HOML2 book](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by Aurélien Géron for k-means and Fran's videos on [API tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgscChKfGyg). 

💻 The code is available [here](https://github.com/tapaco/marametrics).
